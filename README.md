# Week9Assignment

For this assignment, I deployed one honeypot and collected a lot of data.  I used the dionaea honeypot on the Ubunutu 14.04 stack.  The only issue I encountered while completing this assignment was with the installation of the mhn-admin VM.  For some reason, the VM must not have installed fully or correctly because I couldn't access the IP address even with HTTP and HTTPS traffic enabled. I deleted the VM and re-installed and it worked completely from then on.  On my honeypot, as of Sunday 11/5 at 7:45 PM EST, I intercepted 3,790 potential attacks.  About a third of those attacks came from IP address 185.188.207.26.  I thought this week's assignment was really cool hands on experience with NetSec and very interesting to work through.  

P.S. I might be having trouble with uploading the JSON file.  I've uploaded it a few times to the repo as you can see in the committs but github keeps saying the file is empty and won't show up in the repo.  Just in case you need more proof of my honeypot my mhn-admin IP address is 35.194.46.152 and the email and password are storney5@vt.edu and $Torn7396.  This way if the JSON upload didn't work you can still check out the honeypot I used for this assignment.  I will keep the VM up for a week or two so you can see it. Thanks and please let me know if I you need anything more from me!
